    <b>SHA-256 Hashing Algorithm Implemented in C</b>
    <p align="center">SHA-256 is a cryptographic hash function that takes an input and produces a 256-bit (32-byte) hash value. It's widely used in many security applications and protocols.</p>

<h2 id="comments">üóØÔ∏è Comments</h2>
This project was made for educational purposes only. It is not recommended to use this code in production.

There is still some work to be done, such as:
- [ ] Add support for larger and more blocks to be hashed
- [ ] Fix the compute function to work with N consecutive Hash values... (read docs)
- [ ] Add support for hashing many different types
